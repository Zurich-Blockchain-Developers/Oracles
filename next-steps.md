#Next Steps

- supply chain topic (@ninuxch business case), analyse and develop
- review game theory concept (for oracles)
- build oracles, initially may be a single oracle
- in other applications use consensus oracles
- prepare a solution state we want to achieve for our supply chain business case
- prepare different ways to achieve the solution state, present and discuss them at the meetup
